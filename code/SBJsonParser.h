/**
 @brief The JSON parser class.
 
 JSON is mapped to Objective-C types in the following way:
 
 @li Null -> NSNull
 @li String -> NSMutableString
 @li Array -> NSMutableArray
 @li Object -> NSMutableDictionary
 @li Boolean -> NSNumber (initialised with -initWithBool:)
 @li Number -> NSDecimalNumber
 
 Since Objective-C doesn't have a dedicated class for boolean values, these turns into NSNumber
 instances. These are initialised with the -initWithBool: method, and 
 round-trip back to JSON properly. (They won't silently suddenly become 0 or 1; they'll be
 represented as 'true' and 'false' again.)
 
 JSON numbers turn into NSDecimalNumber instances,
 as we can thus avoid any loss of precision. (JSON allows ridiculously large numbers.)
